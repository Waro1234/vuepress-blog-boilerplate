Today went about as I predicted yesterday. However I did manage to start work on designing the editor for the data board app. Immediately ran into some problems doing this. My main issue
currently is how you can see the difference between "editor mode" and normal viewer mode. This will require rigorous testing with many different options when it goes live. This isn't
something I didn't foresee considering the fact that the editor is the heart of the entire operation. Considering that this is about all I did, besides visiting my colleagues, I'll wrap
up this blog and continue with the same thing tomorrow.
