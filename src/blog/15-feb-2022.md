### Blog update
Goodmorning, to start of the day I thought I'd update the blog by saying this idea of mine is officially being upgraded from a "fun project" to something more conceptual. This
also means updating the blog posts and tagging the related posts with the concept tag "CX13". Which stands for concep x13 (clever, I know).

Last night while I was trying to fall asleep I jolted awake with some good ideas for onboarding users. It can be very tricky to build something that is intuitive and easy to setup
but that also has a broad range of features and customization. The onboarding process here is going to be a key aspect. It will help users set up their first board and get them
started with the basic knowledge of the data.

The original plan for today was to work on designing the "editor" part of the operation but I might work on the onboarding process a bit first. Tinkering out the different layers
by creating user personas that will help me identify what paths I'll be needing.
