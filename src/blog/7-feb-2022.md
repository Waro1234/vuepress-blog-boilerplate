This morning I awakened at 6 am and did the schedule that I've so far set out to do. I have
been following this schedule and so far it is going fine but it isn't consistent enough yet
and I've found in the past that starting isn't the difficult part but rather it is keeping
the habbit up and going. Especially if you have one off day it becomes very hard for me to
pick up the schedule again the next day. So I think not taking a single day off from the schedule
(from when i awake) would be the better option for me.

### 11:20am
So the main thing that i wanted to work on today was importing blog posts into markdown and get 
more familiar with its syntax. So far it is going pretty good but I still need to find a writing
style that I'm comfortable with and that I realistically can keep up with. Regardless I've been
able to style the content the way that I want to style it. While changes may come in the future, for
now it will stand as is.
