### Personal Update
Goodmorning, had a bit of a late start (still recovering from jetlag) and I had a morning walk instead of a run. Coming out of ten day isolation and a nineteen day vacation 
took more of a toll on my physique than I had originally anticipated. So I am starting off with a one hour walk per day for a week before committing to a run.

With this out of the way it looks like I'll be able to now focus my efforts on fixing up design flaws on the homescreen i posted in [yesterdays](/blog/13-feb-2022.md) blog.  

### 1:37pm
Yea I am really liking the idea of putting together your own boards with elements of data that you deem useful instead of a predetermined layout. Gives the whole thing a 
more personalized experience. Furthermore I came up with the "top scorers" element for best tradable coins according to your personal filters.

<sup>New element: "Top scorers"</sup>  

> The idea is to turn the overview back into a table (keeping the elements I build) and using the cards to display the best scoring coins.

### 2:40pm
This table might actually work (mind you it's filled with dummy data) the way I want to. It will need some tweaking for mobile and of course the user need to have full
adjustability over what he/she wants to show inside this table.

<sup>Updated element: "Overview"</sup>  

> #### Intermediary market update

### Wrap up
Today was a good day. Despite it being short on the work front I did get the things done that I wanted to get done, namely the components described above. The 
direction change for the app towards a board like structure helped me figure out some monetizing aspects of the product which I'm content with. All in all it 
was a good and productive day. Next step is to think of some more components and to figure out the editting process of boards (design wise) before I think of
a technical structure behind it. With that I'll end todays blog post and thank you for reading.
