### Personal Update
Goodmorning, had a bit of a late start (still recovering from jetlag) and I had a morning walk instead of a run. Coming out of ten day isolation and a nineteen day vacation 
took more of a toll on my physique than I had originally anticipated. So I am starting off with a one hour walk per day for a week before committing to a run.

> #### Market Update
> I checked the market and it doesn't really look great for bitcoin on the high time. Last week closed quite bearish and ALTS looking like they are on the verge of breaking
> support lines. Best guess is to see if you can get spikes up so you can get some better short entries in (or wait until they bearish retest previous support).

With this out of the way it looks like I'll be able to now focus my efforts on fixing up design flaws on the homescreen i posted in [yesterdays](/blog/13-feb-2022.md) blog.
