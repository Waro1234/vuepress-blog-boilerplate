### Personal update
As figured yesterday, screw up once and you will start falling back into old habits. The problem is that I am simply going
to bed way too late which makes me too tired to get up in the wee hours of the morning. This is something I need to adress
if i want to keep up waking early.

Also before I continue further I do recognize that the way my blog posts is very chronological and so my headers may not always
make sense. I might change that a little bit (maybe come up with different sections) but this is something I'll have to
figure out along the way. I'm not a professional writer and this is something I started doing just to keep more focus on
what I want to do. Furthermore I need to figure out times of my day that I want to work on a post because this is also
very over the place right now and structuring this out might be a better idea for me.

With that said the plan for the day (as described yesterday) is to come up with some sketches for the app. The ideal situation is that I 
can finish sketching the idea before I fly home on the 11th of february (praying for that to happen at this point) but the
likelyhood of that isn't very great. However I want to at least finish the main structure.
