### Personal update
Hello, It's been a few days but I've been travelling from Curacao back home and recovering from my jetlag. With that out of the way I can now start commiting more firmly
to the goals that I set out earlier to complete. I will mention that I have not yet been able to do anything design wise for the idea that I had and I'm honestly
doubting if the idea is as good as I thought it was or if I should just work on my friends idea. Regardless I think I should at least come up with some concept sketches
so I can fill up my dribbble page.
