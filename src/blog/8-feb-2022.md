So a bit of bad news, I overslept this morning by 1.5 hours. I hate this and kicking myself for it. 
Slipping back into old habits usually starts with screwing up one time and then continuing that
forward into the next few days. I think I should start setting an alarm clock so that I make sure
I'm awake while I'm not used to the rythm yet. Anyway let's start out the day with a market update.

### Market Update

I figured since I have not really posted a market update in a while (since i got front ran) I'll post one
on here. So what I'm looking at here are range highs and range lows in combination with monthly levels.
The reason I decided to go with monthly levels is simply due to macro uncertainty.

So we bounced from monthly support into monthly resistance. This is a fairly standard move. I'm salty because
I had buys at 32k and never got filled and refused to take entries at 35k. I don't endorses that type of 
behavior because as a trader you need to be nimble and I simply was not.

A sign of continued concern for me is the fact that bigger wallets keep selling into these rips. If you want
to see macro upside then you want to see for big increases in these wallets and that is just not happening.
So in order for me to be confident of an actual phase change (climax bear into accumulation) we need to see
an increase of these wallet sizes.

In the lower timeframes I believe bulls are being more risky right now in a potential HTF area. This is
not really the area I want to play in for the bull side. Maybe it is possible that it takes another stab
at 46-47 but this quick move into HTF resistance makes me cautious until we see acceptance above.
